Voting Protocol
===============

1. Only voting members and FIG Secretaries may initiate a call for votes on a measure.

2. Only voting members may vote on a measure.

3. The time limit on a vote is 14 days from the time of the call for votes, or
until all voting members have cast their vote, whichever comes first. Votes
cast after the time limit are not valid.

4. Votes can be +1 ("in favor"), -1 ("against"), or 0 ("abstain").

5. One-third or more of the *voting members* must vote within the time limit
for the vote to be valid. This is the equivalent of establishing a quorum. For
example:

        - If there are 20, 21, or 22 members, then 7 or more must vote within the
          time limit for the vote to be valid.

        - If there are 23, 24, or 25 members, then 8 or more must vote within the
          time limit for the vote to be valid.

6. The measure passes if a simple majority of the *votes cast* are "in favor".
The measure does not pass otherwise. For example:

        - If there are 10 or 11 votes cast, 6 or more must be "in favor".

        - If there are 12 or 13 votes cast, 7 or more must be "in favor".

7. Measures passed are not binding. A vote "in favor" of a measure is an
indication that the measure is approved, but the voting member may not be able
to apply it immediately for reasons outside the purview of this group.

8. Votes on membership requests represent a special case:

        - Regarding point 1, they may be initiated by non-members.

        - Regarding point 7, it is binding on all members.

9. Responsibility for vote tallying is shared between the member who starts a vote
and the FIG Secretaries, both of whom should confirm the result.

N.b.: "Abstain" votes are counted only for quorum, and are not counted when
calculating majority.
