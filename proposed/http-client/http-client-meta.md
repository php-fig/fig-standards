HTTP Client Meta Document
=========================

## Summary

HTTP request and responses are the two fundamental objects in web programming.
All clients communicating to an external API use some form of HTTP client. Many
libraries are coupled to one specific client or implement a client and/or adapter
layer themselves. This leads to bad library design, version conflicts or too much
code not related to the library domain.

## Why bother?

Thanks to PSR-7 we know how HTTP requests and responses ideally look like, but nothing
defines how a request should be sent and a response received. A common interface for HTTP
client will allow libraries to be decoupled from specific implementation such as Guzzle.

## Scope

### Goals

* A common interface for sending PSR-7 messages.

### Non-Goals

* Support for asynchronous HTTP requests is left for another future PSR;
* This PSR does not define how to configure a HTTP client. It only specifies the 
  default behaviours;
* We aim to be neutral about the use of middlewares (PSR-15).

#### Asynchronous HTTP client

The reason asynchronous requests are not covered by this PSR is the lack of a
common standard for Promises. And a HTTP client PSR should not define its own
promises. At the time the HTTP client PSR was written there was no final PSR
for Promises. 

A separate interface for asynchronous requests can be defined in a separate PSR 
once the promise PSR is accepted. The method signature for asynchronous requests 
has to be different from the method signature for synchronous requests because 
the return type of asynchronous calls will be a Promise. Thus we are forward
compatible and clients will be able to implement one or both interfaces as makes
sense for them.

## Approaches

### Default behavior

The intention of this PSR is to provide library developers with HTTP clients that 
have a well defined behaviour. A library should be able to use any compliant client
without special code to handle client implementation details (Liskov substitution
principle). The PSR does not try to restrict nor define how to configure HTTP clients. 

An alternative approach would be to pass configuration to the client. That approach
would have a few drawbacks: 

* Configuration must be defined by the PSR;
* All clients must support the defined configuration;
* If no configuration is passed to the client, the behavior is unpredictable.

### Exceptions

The domain exceptions `NetworkException` and `RequestException` define
a contract very similar to each other. The chosen approach is to not let them extend each other
because inheritance does not make sense in the domain model. A `RequestException` is simply not a
`NetworkException`.

Allowing exception to extend a `RequestAwareException` and/or `ResponseAwareException` interface
has been discussed but that is a convenience shortcut that one should not take. One should rather
catch the specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.

One could be more granular when defining exception. For example, `TimeOutException` and `HostNotFoundException`
could be subtypes of `NetworkException`. The chosen approach is not to define such subtypes because
the exception handling in a consuming library would in most cases not be different between those exceptions.

#### Throwing exceptions for 4xx and 5xx responses

The initial idea was to allow the client to be configured to throw exceptions for responses
with HTTP status 4xx and 5xx. That approach is not desired because consuming libraries would
have to check for 4xx and 5xx responses twice. First by simply verifying the status code and
then to catch possible exceptions.

To make the specification more predictable, it was decided that HTTP clients never will throw
exceptions for 4xx and 5xx responses.

### Background

The HTTP client PSR has been inspired and created by the [php-http team](https://github.com/orgs/php-http/people).
Back in 2015, they created HTTPlug as a common interface for HTTP clients.
They wanted an abstraction that third party libraries can use to not rely
on a specific HTTP client implementation like Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 or Buzz.
A stable version was tagged in January 2016 and the project got widely
adopted since then. With over 3 million downloads the next
two years it was time to convert this "de-facto" standard into a real PSR.
