HTTP message interfaces
=======================

This document describes common interfaces for representing HTTP messages as
described in [RFC 7230](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) and
[RFC 7231](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

1. Specification
----------------

### 1.1 Messages

An HTTP message is either a request from a client to a server or a response from
a server to a client. This specification defines interfaces for the HTTP messages
`Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` and `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` respectively.

Both `Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` and `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` extend
`Psr\Http\Message\MessageInterface`. While `Psr\Http\Message\MessageInterface` MAY be
implemented directly, implementors are encouraged to implement
`Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` and `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`.


An additional interface, `Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface`, extends
`Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` to model the various PHP superglobals and
provide access to the various request input sources. These include:

- cookies (`$_COOKIE`)
- query string arguments (`$_GET`)
- body parameters (typically `$_POST`, but these could be deserialized JSON or
  other payloads)
- file uploads (`$_FILES`)
- the server environment (`$_SERVER`)

This practice helps reduce coupling to the superglobals by consumers, and
encourages and promotes the ability to test request consumers.

Server variables and file upload information are considered immutable, as they
are calculated by PHP and cannot be re-calculated or derived within the same
request. Cookies, query string arguments, and body parameters, however, are
mutable to reflect the mutable state of their corresponding superglobals, and
to allow for common practices such as body deserialization, cookie decryption,
etc. If the original values are desired, they can be retrieved from the server
parameters and/or request body.

The server request provides one additional mutable property, "attributes", to
allow consumers the ability to introspect, decompose, and match the request
against application-specific rules (such as path matching, scheme matching,
host matching, etc.). As such, the request can also provide messaging between
multiple request consumers.

From here forward, the namespace `Psr\Http\Message` will be omitted when
referring to these interfaces.

#### 1.2 HTTP Headers

##### Case-insensitive header names

HTTP messages include case-insensitive header names. Headers are retrieved by name from
classes implementing the `MessageInterface` interface in a case-insensitive
manner. For example, retrieving the "foo" header will return the same result as
retrieving the "FoO" header. Similarly, setting the "Foo" header will overwrite
any previously set "foo" header.

```php
$message->setHeader('foo', 'bar');
echo $message->getHeader('foo');
// Outputs: bar

echo $message->getHeader('FOO');
// Outputs: bar

$message->setHeader('fOO', 'baz');
echo $message->getHeader('foo');
// Outputs: baz
```

##### Headers with multiple values

In order to accommodate headers with multiple values yet still provide the
convenience of working with headers as strings, headers can be retrieved from
an instance of a ``MessageInterface`` as an array or string. Use the
`getHeader()` method to retrieve a header value as a string containing all
header values of a case-insensitive header by name concatenated with a comma.
Use `getHeaderLines()` to retrieve an array of all the header values for a
particular case-insensitive header by name.

```php
$message->setHeader('foo', 'bar');
$message->addHeader('foo', 'baz');

$header = $message->getHeader('foo');
// $header contains: 'bar, baz'

$header = $message->getHeaderLines('foo');
// ['bar', 'baz']
```

Note: Not all header values can be concatenated using a comma (e.g.,
`Set-Cookie`). When working with such headers, consumers of
`MessageInterface`-based classes SHOULD rely on the `getHeaderLines()` method
for retrieving such multi-valued headers.

### 1.2 Streams

HTTP messages consist of a start-line, headers, and a body. The body of an HTTP
message can be very small or extremely large. Attempting to represent the body
of a message as a string can easily consume more memory than intended because
the body must be stored completely in memory. Attempting to store the body of a
request or response in memory would preclude the use of that implementation from
being able to work with large message bodies. `StreamableInterface` is used in
order to hide the implementation details when a stream of data is read from
or written to. For situations where a string would be an appropriate message
implementation, built-in streams such as `php://memory` and `php://temp` may be
used.

`StreamableInterface` exposes several methods that enable streams to be read
from, written to, and traversed effectively.

Streams expose their capabilities using three methods: `isReadable()`,
`isWritable()`, and `isSeekable()`. These methods can be used by stream
collaborators to determine if a stream is capable of their requirements.

Each stream instance will have various capabilities: it can be read-only,
write-only, or read-write. It can also allow arbitrary random access (seeking
forwards or backwards to any location), or only sequential access (for
example in the case of a socket or pipe).

Finally, `StreamableInterface` defines a `__toString()` method to simplify
retrieving or emitting the entire body contents at once.
