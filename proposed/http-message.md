HTTP message interfaces
=======================

This document describes common interfaces for representing HTTP messages as
described in [RFC 7230](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) and
[RFC 7231](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231), and URIs for use with HTTP
messages as described in [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

HTTP messages are the foundation of web development. Web browsers and HTTP
clients such as cURL create HTTP request messages that are sent to a web server,
which provides an HTTP response message. Server-side code receives an HTTP
request message, and returns an HTTP response message.

HTTP messages are typically abstracted from the end-user consumer, but as
developers, we typically need to know how they are structured and how to
access or manipulate them in order to perform our tasks, whether that might be
making a request to an HTTP API, or handling an incoming request.

Every HTTP request message has a specific form:

```http
POST /path HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

foo=bar&baz=bat
```

The first line of a request is the "request line", and contains, in order, the
HTTP request method, the request target (usually either an absolute URI or a
path on the web server), and the HTTP protocol version. This is followed by one
or more HTTP headers, an empty line, and the message body.

HTTP response messages have a similar structure:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

This is the response body
```

The first line is the "status line", and contains, in order, the HTTP protocol
version, the HTTP status code, and a "reason phrase," a human-readable
description of the status code. Just like the request message, this is then
followed by one or more HTTP headers, and empty line, and the message body.

The interfaces described in this document are abstractions around HTTP messages
and the elements composing them.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

1. Specification
----------------

### 1.1 Messages

An HTTP message is either a request from a client to a server or a response from
a server to a client. This specification defines interfaces for the HTTP messages
`Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` and `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` respectively.

Both `Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` and `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` extend
`Psr\Http\Message\MessageInterface`. While `Psr\Http\Message\MessageInterface` MAY be
implemented directly, implementors SHOULD implement
`Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` and `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`.

From here forward, the namespace `Psr\Http\Message` will be omitted when
referring to these interfaces.

#### 1.2 HTTP Headers

##### Case-insensitive header names

HTTP messages include case-insensitive header names. Headers are retrieved by name from
classes implementing the `MessageInterface` interface in a case-insensitive
manner. For example, retrieving the "foo" header will return the same result as
retrieving the "FoO" header. Similarly, setting the "Foo" header will overwrite
any previously set "foo" header.

```php
$message = $message->withHeader('foo', 'bar');

echo $message->getHeader('foo');
// Outputs: bar

echo $message->getHeader('FOO');
// Outputs: bar

$message = $message->withHeader('fOO', 'baz');
echo $message->getHeader('foo');
// Outputs: baz
```

Despite that headers may be retrieved case-insenstively, the original case
MUST be preserved by the implementation, in particular when retrieved with
`getHeaders()`.

Non-conforming HTTP applications may depend on a certain case, so it is useful
for a user to be able to dictate the case of the HTTP headers when creating a
request or response.

##### Headers with multiple values

In order to accommodate headers with multiple values yet still provide the
convenience of working with headers as strings, headers can be retrieved from
an instance of a ``MessageInterface`` as an array or string. Use the
`getHeader()` method to retrieve a header value as a string containing all
header values of a case-insensitive header by name concatenated with a comma.
Use `getHeaderLines()` to retrieve an array of all the header values for a
particular case-insensitive header by name.

```php
$message = $message
    ->withHeader('foo', 'bar')
    ->withAddedHeader('foo', 'baz');

$header = $message->getHeader('foo');
// $header contains: 'bar, baz'

$header = $message->getHeaderLines('foo');
// ['bar', 'baz']
```

Note: Not all header values can be concatenated using a comma (e.g.,
`Set-Cookie`). When working with such headers, consumers of
`MessageInterface`-based classes SHOULD rely on the `getHeaderLines()` method
for retrieving such multi-valued headers.

### 1.3 Streams

HTTP messages consist of a start-line, headers, and a body. The body of an HTTP
message can be very small or extremely large. Attempting to represent the body
of a message as a string can easily consume more memory than intended because
the body must be stored completely in memory. Attempting to store the body of a
request or response in memory would preclude the use of that implementation from
being able to work with large message bodies. `StreamableInterface` is used in
order to hide the implementation details when a stream of data is read from
or written to. For situations where a string would be an appropriate message
implementation, built-in streams such as `php://memory` and `php://temp` may be
used.

`StreamableInterface` exposes several methods that enable streams to be read
from, written to, and traversed effectively.

Streams expose their capabilities using three methods: `isReadable()`,
`isWritable()`, and `isSeekable()`. These methods can be used by stream
collaborators to determine if a stream is capable of their requirements.

Each stream instance will have various capabilities: it can be read-only,
write-only, or read-write. It can also allow arbitrary random access (seeking
forwards or backwards to any location), or only sequential access (for
example in the case of a socket, pipe, or callback-based stream).

Finally, `StreamableInterface` defines a `__toString()` method to simplify
retrieving or emitting the entire body contents at once.

### 1.4 Request Targets and URIs

Per RFC 7230, request messages contain a "request-target" as the second segment
of the request line. The request target can be one of the following forms:

- **origin-form**, which consists of the path, and, if present, the query
  string; this is often referred to as a relative URL. Messages as transmitted
  over TCP typically are of origin-form; scheme and authority data are usually
  only present via CGI variables.
- **absolute-form**, which consists of the scheme, authority
  ("[user-info@]host[:port]", where items in brackets are optional), path (if
  present), query string (if present), and fragment (if present). This is often
  referred to as an absolute URI, and is the only form to specify a URI as
  detailed in RFC 3986. This form is commonly used when making requests to
  HTTP proxies.
- **authority-form**, which consists of the authority only. This is typically
  used in CONNECT requests only, to establish a connection between an HTTP
  client and a proxy server.
- **asterisk-form**, which consists solely of the string '*', and which is used
  with the OPTIONS method to determine the general capabilities of a web server.

Aside from these request-targets, there is often an 'effective URL' which is
separate from the request target. The effective URL is not transmitted within
a HTTP message, but it is used to determine the protocol (http/https), port
and hostname for making the request.

The effective URL is represented by `UriInterface`. `UriInterface` models HTTP
and HTTPS URIs as specified in RFC 3986 (the primary use case). The interface
provides methods for interacting with the various URI parts, which will obviate
the need for repeated parsing of the URI. It also specifies a `__toString()`
method for casting the modeled URI to its string representation.

When retrieving the request-target with `getRequestTarget()`, by default this
method will use the URI object and extract all the necessary components to
construct the _origin-form_. The _origin-form_ is by far the most common
request-target.

If it's desired by an end-user to use one of the other three forms, or if the
user wants to explictly override the request-target, it is possible to do so
with `withRequestTarget()`.

Calling this method does not affect the URI, as it is returned from `getUri()`.

For example, a user may want to make an asterisk-form request to a server:

```php
$request = $request
    ->withMethod('OPTIONS')
    ->withRequestForm('*')
    ->withUri(new Uri('https://example.org/'));
```

This example may ultimately result in a HTTP request that looks like this:

```http
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
```

But the HTTP client will be able to use the effective url (from `getUri()`),
to determine the protocol, hostname and tcp port.

A HTTP client MUST ignore the values of `Uri::getPath()` and `Uri::getQuery()`,
and instead use the value returned by `getRequestTarget()`, which defaults
to concatenating these two values.

Clients that choose to not implement 1 or more of the 4 request-target forms,
MUST still use `getRequestTarget()`. These clients MUST reject request-targets
they do not support, and MUST NOT fall back on the values from `getUri()`.

`RequestInterface` provides methods for retrieving the request-target or
creating a new instance with the provided request-target. By default, if no
request-target is specifically composed in the instance, `getRequestTarget()`
will return the origin-form of the composed URI (or "/" if no URI is composed).
`withRequestTarget($requestTarget)` creates a new instance with the
specified request target, and thus allows developers to create request messages
that represent the other three request-target forms (absolute-form,
authority-form, and asterisk-form). When used, the composed URI instance can
still be of use, particularly in clients, where it may be used to create the
connection to the server.

### 1.5 Server-side Requests

`RequestInterface` provides the general representation of an HTTP request
message. However, server-side requests need additional treatment, due to the
nature of the server-side environment. Server-side processing needs to take into
account Common Gateway Interface (CGI), and, more specifically, PHP's
abstraction and extension of CGI via its Server APIs (SAPI). PHP has provided
simplification around input marshaling via superglobals such as:

- `$_COOKIE`, which deserializes and provides simplified access for HTTP
  cookies.
- `$_GET`, which deserializes and provides simplified access for query string
  arguments.
- `$_POST`, which deserializes and provides simplified access for urlencoded
  parameters submitted via HTTP POST.
- `$_FILES`, which provides serialized metadata around file uploads.
- `$_SERVER`, which provides access to CGI/SAPI environment variables, which
  commonly include the request method, the request scheme, the request URI, and
  headers.

`ServerRequestInterface` extends `RequestInterface` to provide an abstraction
around these various superglobals. This practice helps reduce coupling to the
superglobals by consumers, and encourages and promotes the ability to test
request consumers.

The server request provides one additional property, "attributes", to allow
consumers the ability to introspect, decompose, and match the request against
application-specific rules (such as path matching, scheme matching, host
matching, etc.). As such, the server request can also provide messaging between
multiple request consumers.
