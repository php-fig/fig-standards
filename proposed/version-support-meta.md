PSR-Version Support Meta Document
=================================

1. Summary
----------

PHP has a long history of slow adoption of new versions of the language. A major
factor in that slow adoption curve is the reluctance of public web hosts to upgrade
their offerings without pressure from their customers, while major PHP projects
are reluctant to adopt new PHP versions while few public hosts support it. Few
projects wish to be the first to drop old versions for fear of alienating their
user base. This chicken-and-egg problem is one of the reasons why many PHP projects
lag far behind PHP itself in terms of the languages features they adopt.


2. Why Bother?
--------------

"What version can we support?" is a frequent challenge for PHP projects. That
debate can eat up considerable development time, and fear of alienating users
on older PHP versions can prevent a project from adopting new language features 
that would benefit the project and its users.  That reluctance, in turn, means
there is no incentive for public hosts to offer newer PHP versions that would 
resolve that issue.

This standard draws inspiration from the GoPHP5 initiative from 2007. In that 
case, numerous projects and hosts collectively agreed on a drop-dead date for
all PHP 4 versions, and that future releases would standardize on at least PHP 5.2.
That initiative was successful in breaking the log-jam that kept PHP 4 alive well
past its retirement and delayed the implementation of PHP 5.

Rather than periodic "surge" efforts, this standard creates a rolling-GoPHP process
that both projects and hosts can build into their planning.


3. Scope
--------

## 3.1 Goals

This standard serves as a "community covenant" for projects and hosts to agree on
an approximate schedule for when they will adopt and drop support for PHP versions.
By synchronizing release schedules, no project is overly penalized for being first
to drop support for a given PHP version and public hosts have a clear timeline
they can factor into their normal upgrade schedules.

## 3.2 Non-Goals

This document does not seek to impose any architectural decisions on participating
projects, nor to dictate what language features they use.


4. Example release schedule
---------------------------

The following examples help illustrate with examples how a participating project
and host could operate with respect to PHP releases.

## 4.1 For projects

### 4.1.1 PHP minor releases

Flubber 4.2 is the current release.  PHP 9.2.3 is the current stable release.

On 1 March 2020, PHP 9.3.0 is released.

Flubber 4.3 is released on 20 March. It is unaffected, because PHP 9.3 has been
out for less than 90 days.

Flubber 4.4 is released on 14 July. It is required to support PHP 9.3 because
it has been out for more than 90 days.

On 1 March 2021, PHP 9.4. is released.

Flubber 5.0 is released on 20 March. It is unaffected, because PHP 9.4 has been
out for less than 6 months.

### 4.1.2 PHP major releases


## 4.2 For hosts

PHP 9.2.3 is the current stable release, and was released on 1 March 2020.
PHP 9.1 is the legacy release.  PHP  9.0 is in security-only status.  Flubber
Hosting offers PHP 9.2.1.

Flubber Hosting has until 1 June 2020 to offer PHP 9.2.3.  When it does so it
replaces all its 9.2.1 offerings with 9.2.3.

PHP 9.3.0 is released on 1 July 2020.  Flubber Hosting has until 1 January 2021
to offer 9.3.0.  It may make it the default for new accounts or not, but both
new and old accounts must have the option to use it.

PHP 9.0 security support ends entirely on 1 October 2020.  Flubber Hosting has
until 1 October 2022 to cease offering PHP 9.0.x.

PHP 10.0 is released on 1 April 2021.  Flubber Hosting has until 1 April 2022
to offer it for both new and old accounts. It may be the default or not.  If
a new minor or patch release comes out before then, it should be treated
accordingly.
