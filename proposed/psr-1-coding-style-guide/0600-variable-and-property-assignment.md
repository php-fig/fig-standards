Variable and Property Assignment
================================

Single Assignment
-----------------

Assignment looks like the following.

    $foo = 'value';

To support readability, contiguous assignments may be aligned on the equals
sign:

    $short  = fooBar($baz);
    $longer = dibGir($zim);


Multi-Line Assignment
---------------------

Assignments may be split onto several lines when the line length limit is
exceeded. The equals sign has to be positioned onto the following line, and
indented once.

    $this->longArrayPropertyName[$this->someOtherPropertyValue]
        = $object->getFunctionResult(ClassName::CONSTANT_VALUE);

Similarly, when concatenating strings across multiple lines, align the dot
operator with the equals:

    $foo = 'prefix string '
         . $object->getSomeStringResult()
         . ' suffix string';

    $bar .= 'prefix string '
          . $object->getSomeStringResult()
          . ' suffix string';


Ternary Assignment
------------------

Ternary assignments may be split onto subsequent lines when the exceed the
line length limit, or when the would be more readable. Align the question mark
and colon with the equals sign.

    $foo = ($expression1 && $expression2)
         ? $foo
         : $bar;

    $bar = ($expression3 && $expression4)
         ? $a_very_long_variable_name
         : $bar;


Assignment By Reference
-----------------------

When assigning by reference, the `&` should be attached to the variable, not
the operator:

    // incorrect
    $foo =& $bar;
    
    // correct
    $foo = &$bar;


Array Assignment
----------------

Array assignments may be split across subsequent lines if they would otherwise
break the line length limit, or if it would improve readability. They should be
indented once per array, and should be aligned on the `=>` double arrow. The
last value in each array should have a trailing comma; this is valid syntax
and reduces the chance of syntax violations when adding new elements.

    $an_array = [
        'foo'      => 'bar',
        'subarray' => [
            'baz'  => 'dib',
            'zim'  => 'gir',
        ],
        'irk'      => 'doom',
    ];
