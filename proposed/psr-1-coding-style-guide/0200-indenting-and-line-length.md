Indenting and Line Length
=========================

Indenting
---------

Use an indent of 4 spaces. Do not use tabs. The use of spaces helps to avoid
problems with diffs, patches, history, and annotations, and provides
fine-grained sub-indentation when aligning elements on consecutive lines.

Line Length
-----------

Lines should be limited to 80 characters in length. This is based on known
human cognitive limitations, not the technical limitations of screen windows
or text editors. When necessary, it is allowed to split a single statement
across subsequent lines, per rules noted elsewhere in this guide.

Some further insight into the 80 characters rule:

> How many words per line can a person scan, and still be able to grasp the
> content of the line in the context of the surrounding lines? Printing and
> publishing typographers figured out a long time ago that most people can
> read no more than 10 to 12 words per line before they have trouble
> differentiating lines from each other. (A “word” is counted as five
> characters on average.) Even allowing for a 25% to 50% increase, that
> brings us up to 15 words. Times 5 characters per word, that means 75
> characters on a line.
> 
> So the style guide limitation on line length is not exactly arbitrary. It
> is about the developer’s ability to effectively scan and comprehend
> strings of text, not about the technical considerations of terminals and
> text-editors.

Other Considerations
--------------------

Code blocks may have as many blank lines as needed to increase readability
and comprehension.

Do not add trailing spaces at the end of lines.
