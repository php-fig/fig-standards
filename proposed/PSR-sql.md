SQL Style Guide
===============

This guide extends and expands on [PSR-2][], the basic coding standard.

The intent of this guide is to avoid common mal practices with SQL handling in PHP.

**Notice:**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

----

- Currently this Guide only intends to help on static queries and lacks of information on dynamically queries
- This guide purposely avoids mentioning naming conventions for tables, fields or alias

--- 

[RFC 2119]: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt
[PSR-2]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md

1. Overview
-----------

- Code MUST follow [PSR-2][]
- Code MUST use PDO extension

2. SQL Syntax
--------------

### 2.1 Example

```SQL
SELECT Sales.id as SalesId
    Sales.`date`,
    Items.price,
    Items.price * Sales.quantity as earnings

From ItemSales as Sales,
    Items

Where Sales.itemId = Items.id
    and Items.id = :Items_id

Limit :limit_min, :limit_max
```

### 2.2 Keywords

The keywords are divided in three types
 
- Definition keyword: Define the type or query `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`
- Block keyworkds: Are used at most once and separate the query in sections `where`, `from`, `limit`, `order by`, `join`
- Operation keywords: Are used inside operations `and`, `or`, `not`, `null`

Dividing the keywords in types help to organize and understand the query, not all keywords work the same and shouldn't be treated the same.

### 2.3 Basic Syntax

- Definition keywords MUST be written in UPPERCASE
- Block keywords MUST be written Capitalized
- Operational keywords MUST be written in lowercase
- `SELECT *` MUST NOT be used. Instead its necessary to make a list of all the required fields. This helps redability and avoid redundancy
- `as` keyword MUST NOT be ommited when using alias
- Reserved words used on fields or tables MUST alway be escaped.
- Unreserved words used on fields or tables SHOULD NOT be escaped. MySQL, Oracle and MSDB escape reserved words differently.

### 2.4 Blocks

SQL blocks are to be understood as sections of the query divided by SQL keywords such as `from`, `where`, `order by`, etc.

- There MUST be a blank line separating blocks
- There MUST be a line break after every field, table or other items used on blocks
- There MUST be a line break after every condition used on the `where`, `having` and `group by` blocks
- Items inside blocks MUST be indented

Organizing the query in blocks and multiple lines improves readability, help the maintenance and debugging.

### 2.5 Parameters

- Paramaters MUST have the name of the field `:fieldname` or `:Tablename_fieldname` if more than one table have a field with that name
- Parameters SHOULD be declared at the end blocks
- Parameters `limit` SHOULD be declared using `:limit_min` and `:limit_max`

3. PHP SQL variables
--------------------

```PHP
class ClassName
{
    private static $query = <<<'SQL'
SELECT Sales.id as SalesId
    Sales.`date`,
    Items.price,
    Items.price * Sales.quantity as earnings

From ItemSales as Sales,
    Items

Where Sales.itemId = Items.id
    and Items.id = :Items_id

Limit :limit_min, :limit_max
SQL;
}
```

- .sql files MUST NOT be used inside the DOCUMENT ROOT
- Query declaration MUST use single quotes
- Query declaration SHOULD use `nowdoc` for PHP 5.3 using SQL to add syntax higlight
- When the query is executed inside a class method the query variables SHOULD be stored in private propertys. This will allow to keep the queries separated from the methods definition
- When used inside a function, queries SHOULD be declared at the beggining of the function definition. This will allow to keep the queries separated from the function definition

4. Best Practices
-----------------

### 4.1 Fetch

The `PDOStatement::fetchAll` method SHOULD NOT be used.

Using this method to fetch large result sets will result in a heavy demand on system and possibly network resources. Rather than retrieving all of the data and manipulating it in PHP, consider using the database server to manipulate the result sets.

The class `PDOStatement` implements the `Transversable` interface which allow it to be used inside loops like `foreach`.

### 4.2 Join

Try to use joins instead of having multiple queries and joining the information using PHP.

5. Survey
---------

### 5.1 Survey proposed questions

`keyword_types`: Separate the keywords in types as proposed in 2.2.1

`keywords`: How are the keywords capitalized. `upper` = Uppercase, `lower` = lowercase, `capital` = Uppercase only for the first letter

`asterisk`: Is the use of asterisk permitted? `yes`, `no`

`as_keywork`: The alias keyword MUST NOT be ommited `yes`, `no`, `?`

`reserved_words_escape`: Reserved words must always be escaped?

`not_reserved_words_escape`: Non reserved words should not be escaped? `yes`, `no`, `?`

`block_line_separation`: Separate blocks with a blank line

`block_line_break`: Line break after block items.

`block_indentation`: Items inside blocks should be indented?

`sql_comments`: Allow SQL comments?

`sql_file` .sql files MUST NOT be used inside the DOCUMENT ROOT?

`single_quotes` Query declaration MUST use single quotes?

`nowdoc` Query declaration SHOULD use nowdoc?

`readonly_property` When the query is executed inside a class method the query variables SHOULD be stored in private read-only property?

`variable_function_start` When used inside a function, queries SHOULD be declared at the start of the function definition. This will allow to keep the queries separated from the function definition

`bestpracitices` Include a best practices section `yes` `no`
