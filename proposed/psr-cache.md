Common Interface for Caching libraries
================

This document describes a simple yet extensible interface for a cache item and
a cache driver.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

The final implementations MAY be able to decorate the objects with more
functionality that the one proposed but they MUST implement the indicated
interfaces/functionality first.

[RFC 2119]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119

1. Specification
-----------------

## 1.1 Introduction

Caching is a common way to improve the performance of any project, making
caching libraries one of the most common features of many frameworks and
libraries. This has lead to a situation where many libraries roll their own
caching libraries, with various levels of functionality. These differences are
causing developers to have to learn multiple systems which may or may not
provide the functionality they need. In addition, the developers of caching
libraries themselves face a choice between only supporting a limited number
of frameworks or creating a large number of adapter classes.

A common interface for caching systems will solve these problems. Library and
framework developers can count on the caching systems working the way they're
expecting, while the developers of caching systems will only have to implement
a single set of interfaces rather than a whole assortment of adapters.

### 1.2 Definitions

*    **TTL** - The Time To Live (TTL) of an item is the amount of time between
when that item is stored and it is considered stale. The TTL is normally defined
by an integer representing time in seconds.

*    **Expiration** - The actual time when an item is set to go stale. 

    An item with a 300 second TTL stored at 1:30:00 will have an expiration at
    1:35:00.

*    **Key** - A string that uniquely identifies the cached item. Implementing
Libraries are responsible for any encoding or escaping required by their
backends, but must be able to supply the original key if needed.

### 1.3 CacheItem

By `CacheItem` we refer to a object that implements the
`Psr\Cache\CacheItemInterface` interface.

By using the cache item implementations will guarantee consistency across
various systems and ensure that the user will always retrieve the expected
data without performing any additional operations.

The `CacheItem` objects are generated by the `Cache` class. `CacheItem` objects
encapsulate the key and value of the stored cache entry

### 1.4 Cache

By `Cache` we refer to a object that implements the `Psr\Cache\CacheInterface`
interface.

If the user does not provide a TTL value then the `Cache` MUST set a default
value that is either configured by the user or, if not available, the maximum
value allowed by cache system. If the cache system does not support a TTL
option then the user specified or the default TTL values will be ignored.

It will be the implementation job to define what values are considered valid
or invalid for key names or TTL values based on what the underlying driver can
accept but the user MUST be aware of the accepted values for both the TTL
values as well as for key names.

2. Interfaces
----------

### 2.1 CacheItem

```php

<?php

namespace Psr\Cache;

interface CacheItemInterface
{

    /**
     * Get the key associated with this CacheItem
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function getKey();

    /**
     * Obtain the value of this cache item
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function getValue();

    /**
     * Set the value of the item
     *
     * @param mixed $value
     */
    public function setValue($value);

    /**
     * This boolean value tells us if our cache item is currently in the cache or not
     *
     * @return boolean
     */
    public function isHit();

}

```

### 2.2 Cache

```php

<?php

namespace Psr\Cache;

use Psr\Cache\CacheItemInterface;

interface CacheInterface
{

    /**
     * Here we pass in a cache key to be fetched from the cache.
     * A CacheItem object will be constructed and returned to us
     *
     * @param string $key The unique key of this item in the cache
     *
     * @return CacheItem  The newly populated CacheItem class representing the stored data in the cache
     */
    public function getItem($key);

    /**
     * Persisting our data in the cache, uniquely referenced by a key with an optional expiration TTL time.
     *
     * @param string       $key The key of the item to store
     * @param mixed        $val The value of the item to store
     * @param null|integer $ttl Optional. The TTL value of this item. If no value is sent and the driver supports TTL
     *                          then the library may set a default value for it or let the driver take care of that.
     *
     * @return boolean
     */
    public function set($key, $val, $ttl = null);

    /**
     * Remove an item from the cache by its unique key
     *
     * @param string $key The unique cache key of the item to remove
     *
     * @return boolean    The result of the delete operation
     */
    public function remove($key);

    /**
     * Obtain multiple CacheItems by their unique keys
     *
     * @param array $keys A list of keys that can obtained in a single operation.
     *
     * @return array An array of CacheItem classes.
     *               The resulting array must use the CacheItem's key as the associative key for the array.
     */
    public function getItems($keys);

    /**
     * Persistence or re-persistence of multiple CacheItem objects.
     * If the TTL is not null then the TTL value for the Item will be overwritten either by this new TTL value
     *
     * @param array        $items An array of key => value pairs for a multiple-set operation.
     * @param null|integer $ttl   Optional. The TTL value of this item. If no value is sent and the driver supports TTL
     *                            then the library may set a default value for it or let the driver take care of that.
     *
     * @return boolean The result of the multiple-set operation
     */
    public function setItems($items, $ttl = null);

    /**
     * Remove multiple cache items in a single operation
     *
     * @param array $keys The array of keys to be removed
     *
     * @return array An array of 'key' => result, elements. Each array row has the key being deleted
     *               and the result of that operation. The result will be a boolean of true or false
     *               representing if the cache item was removed or not
     */
    public function removeItems($keys);

    /**
     * This will wipe out the entire cache's keys
     *
     * @return boolean The result of the empty operation
     */
    public function clear();

}

```
