Common Interface for Caching libraries
================

This document describes a simple yet extensible interface for a cache item and
a cache driver.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

The final implementations MAY be able to decorate the objects with more
functionality than the one proposed but they MUST implement the indicated
interfaces/functionality first.

[RFC 2119]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119

1. Specification
-----------------

## 1.1 Introduction

Caching is a common way to improve the performance of any project, making
caching libraries one of the most common features of many frameworks and
libraries. This has led to a situation where many libraries roll their own
caching libraries, with various levels of functionality. These differences are
causing developers to have to learn multiple systems which may or may not
provide the functionality they need. In addition, the developers of caching
libraries themselves face a choice between only supporting a limited number
of frameworks or creating a large number of adapter classes.

A common interface for caching systems will solve these problems. Library and
framework developers can count on the caching systems working the way they're
expecting, while the developers of caching systems will only have to implement
a single set of interfaces rather than a whole assortment of adapters.

### 1.2 Definitions

*    **TTL** - The Time To Live (TTL) of an item is the amount of time between
when that item is stored and it is considered stale. The TTL is normally defined
by an integer representing time in seconds.

*    **Expiration** - The actual time when an item is set to go stale. 

    An item with a 300 second TTL stored at 1:30:00 will have an expiration at
    1:35:00.

*    **Key** - A string that uniquely identifies the cached item. Implementing
libraries are responsible for any encoding or escaping required by their
backends, but must be able to supply the original key if needed.

### 1.3 CacheItem

By `CacheItem` we refer to a object that implements the
`Psr\Cache\CacheItemInterface` interface.

By using the `CacheItem` class implementations can guarantee consistency across
various systems.

The `CacheItem` objects are generated by the `Cache` class. `CacheItem` objects
encapsulate the key and value of the stored cache entry.  `CacheItem` objects
SHOULD NOT be created in any other way.

### 1.4 Cache

By `Cache` we refer to a object that implements the `Psr\Cache\CacheInterface`
interface.

Implementations MAY provide a mechanism for a user to specify a default TTL 
if one is not specified for a specific cache item.  If no user-specified default 
is provided implementations MUST default to the maximum legal value allowed by 
the underlying implementation.  If the underlying implementation does not 
support TTL, the user-specified TTL MUST be silently ignored.

Implementations MUST accept keys that consist of up to 32 characters, containing
the ASCII values A-Z, z-z, 0-9, _, ., and -.  That is the minimum requirement 
for keys is the regular expression [A-Z|a-z|0-9|\.|\-|\_]{1,32}.
Implementations MAY allow additional characters or extended ASCCI-compatible 
character sets (such as UTF-8), but these characters MUST always be legal.

2. Interfaces
----------

### 2.1 CacheItem

```php

<?php

namespace Psr\Cache;

interface CacheItemInterface
{

    /**
     * Get the key associated with this CacheItem
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function getKey();

    /**
     * Obtain the value of this cache item
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function getValue();

    /**
     * This boolean value tells us if our cache item is currently in the cache or not
     *
     * @return boolean
     */
    public function isHit();

}

```

### 2.2 Cache

```php

<?php

namespace Psr\Cache;

use Psr\Cache\CacheItemInterface;

interface CacheInterface
{

    /**
     * Here we pass in a cache key to be fetched from the cache.
     * A CacheItem object will be constructed and returned to us
     *
     * @param string $key The unique key of this item in the cache
     *
     * @return CacheItemInterface The newly populated CacheItem class representing the stored data in the cache
     */
    public function get($key);

    /**
     * Persisting our data in the cache, uniquely referenced by a key with an optional expiration TTL time.
     *
     * @param string       $key   The key of the item to store
     * @param mixed        $value The value of the item to store
     * @param null|integer $ttl   Optional. The TTL value of this item. If no value is sent and the driver supports TTL
     *                            then the library may set a default value for it or let the driver take care of that.
     *
     * @return boolean
     */
    public function set($key, $value, $ttl = null);

    /**
     * Remove an item from the cache by its unique key
     *
     * @param string $key The unique cache key of the item to remove
     *
     * @return boolean    The result of the delete operation
     */
    public function remove($key);

    /**
     * Obtain multiple CacheItems by their unique keys
     *
     * @param array $keys A list of keys that can obtained in a single operation.
     *
     * @return array An array of CacheItem classes.
     *               The resulting array must use the CacheItem's key as the associative key for the array.
     */
    public function getMultiple($keys);

    /**
     * Persisting a set of key => value pairs in the cache, with an optional TTL.
     *
     * @param array        $items An array of key => value pairs for a multiple-set operation.
     * @param null|integer $ttl   Optional. The TTL value of this item. If no value is sent and the driver supports TTL
     *                            then the library may set a default value for it or let the driver take care of that.
     *
     * @return boolean The result of the multiple-set operation
     */
    public function setMultiple($items, $ttl = null);

    /**
     * Remove multiple cache items in a single operation
     *
     * @param array $keys The array of keys to be removed
     *
     * @return array An array of 'key' => result, elements. Each array row has the key being deleted
     *               and the result of that operation. The result will be a boolean of true or false
     *               representing if the cache item was removed or not
     */
    public function removeMultiple($keys);

    /**
     * This will wipe out the entire cache's keys
     *
     * @return boolean The result of the clear operation
     */
    public function clear();

}

```

### 2.3 CacheAwareInterface

``` php
<?php

namespace Psr\Cache;

interface CacheAwareInterface
{
    /**
     * Sets a cache instance on the object
     *
     * @param CacheInterface $cache
     * @return null
     */
    public function setCache(CacheInterface $cache);
}
```
