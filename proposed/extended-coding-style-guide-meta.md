Extended Coding Style Guide Meta Document
=========================================

1. Summary
----------

This document describes the process and discussions that led to the Extended Coding
Style PSR. Its goal is to explain the reasons behind each decision.

2. Why Bother?
--------------

PSR-2 was accepted in 2012 and since then a number of changes have been made to PHP,
most notably recent changes for PHP 7, which have implications for coding style
guidelines. Whilst PSR-2 is very comprehensive of PHP functionality that existed at
the time of writing, new functionality is very open to interpretation. PSR__x__2 seeks
to provide a set way that both coding style tools can implement, projects can declare
adherence to and developers can easily relate on between different projects for these
coding style reducing cognitive friction.

PSR-2 was created based upon the common practices of the PHP FIG projects at the time
but ultimately this meant it was a compromise of many of the different projects' guidelines.
The repercussions of projects changing their coding guidelines to align with PSR-2 (Almost
all projects do align with PSR__x__, even if it is not explicitly stated) were seen to be too
great (losing git history, huge changesets and breaking existing patches/pull requests).

PSR-2 required adopters to reformat large amounts of existing code which stifled adoption.
To help alleviate this issue with PSR__x__2, we have taken a more prescriptive approach and
defined the standards for new language features as they are released. We hope that because
this specification is defined prior to mass amounts of code being written, it will have a
better chance of being adopted but this is in the hope that it will mean that projects.

However it is for a lack of wanting to be dictatorial that we will aim to apply PSR-2
styling, rationale and stances (Described in Section 4, Approaches) in PSR__x__2 instead of
establishing new conventions.

3. Scope
--------

## 3.1 Goals

This PSR shares the same goals as PSR-2.

> The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from
> different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations
> about how to format PHP code.
> When various authors collaborate across multiple projects, it helps to have one set
> of guidelines to be used among all those projects. Thus, the benefit of this guide is
> not in the rules themselves, but in the sharing of those rules.

This PSR is an extension of PSR-2, and therefore also an extension of PSR__x__. The basis of
PSR__x__2 is PSR-2 and therefore a list of differences is provided below to assist with migration
but it should be considered as an independent specification.

This PSR will include coding style guidelines related to new functionality added to PHP
after the publication of PSR-2; this includes PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0. This PSR will
also include clarifications on the text of PSR-2, as described in the PSR-2 Errata.

## 3.2 Non-Goals

It is not the intention of this PSR to add entirely new coding style guidelines PSR__x__2 will
also not change anything stipulated in PSR__x__ and PSR-2.

4. Approaches
-------------

The overarching approach is to attempt to apply existing PSR-2 styling and rationale to
new functionality as opposed to establishing new conventions.

### Strict Types Declarations

There was a discussion about whether or not strict types should be enforced in the standard
https://github.com/cs-extended/fig-standards/issues/7. All were in agreement we should only
use a MUST or MUST NOT statement and avoid the use of a SHOULD statement and nobody wanted
to say that strict types could not be declared. The discussion was whether it should be
considered a coding style item which should be covered or whether it was out of scope and it
was decided to be out of scope of a coding style guide.

## Finally and Return Types Declaration Spacing

Numerous different options were suggested and they can be seen
[here for return type declarations](https://gist.github.com/michaelcullum/c025f3870c9ea1dd2668#file-returntypesspacing-php) or
[here for finally blocks](https://gist.github.com/michaelcullum/c025f3870c9ea1dd2668#file-finallyblocks-php)
and the current implementation was chosen due to consistency with other parts of the PSR__x__2
specification that came from PSR-2.

## Enforcing short form for all type keywords

PHP 7.0 introduced [scalar types declaration](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration)
which does not support long type aliases. Therefore it makes sense to enforce primary short type forms to be used to
have uniform syntax and prevent possible confusion.



## Public Survey

In order to settle things using data, survey was conducted and responses from 142 people 
including 17 project representatives were gathered:
