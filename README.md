PHP Framework Interoperability Group
====================================

The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim.

Proposing a Standards Recommendation
------------------------------------

To propose a standards recommendation (PSR):

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the PSR in
  `proposed/`, push the branch to Github, and send a pull request; or,

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github; or,

- start a conversation on the [mailing list][].

[mailing list]: http://groups.google.com/group/php-fig/


Requesting Membership
---------------------

You **do not** need to be a voting member to participate in discussion on
the [mailing list][].
