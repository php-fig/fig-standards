# PHP Standards Group (aka. Framework Interoperabilit Group)

## Introduction

In mid 2009 a group of known PHP project leaders joined forces with the 
intention to bring some standardization between different projects. From that 
original idea, they settled a group called PHP Standards Group, which can also
be referred as Framework Interoperability Group (FIG).

Every proposal is referred here as a Specification or a Recommendation (PSR).

## Recommendation statuses

Each PSR must go through a couple of statuses until it becomes a valid 
Recommendation signed by Standards Group.

The specification working statuses are:

- Step 1: Early Draft Review

  > One an idea of a Recommendation is approved by Board, a group of experts 
  > is formed to develop the first draft of the specification that Board can
  > review or add comments.

- Step 2: Public Review 

  > After PSR is drafted, it goes for review by the public where anyone can
  > read and comment on the draft. The Board uses the public feedback to 
  > further revise the document.

- Step 3: Proposed Final Draft

  > At this stage  of the draft specification, Board will approve and 
  > specification group will use it as the basis for contract and sample
  > implementations (aka. as Reference Implementation and Technology 
  > Compatibility Kit).

- Step 4: Final Release

  > The spec group then sees that the Reference Implementation (RI) and the 
  > Technology Compatiblity Kit (TCK) are completed before sending to the Board
  > for final approval.

Every Specification is organized by its current status. These statuses 
represent at which stage the document is currently and also allow better 
separation of what was already proposed, and what is approved or rejected by 
the Board.

The specification approval statuses are:

- Accepted
  
  > PHP Standards Recommendation that have been approved by Board.

- Inactive

  > Recommendations that have not posted a Final Release and have not changed 
  > internal status in the last 18 months.

- Ongoing

  > Currently Recommendations that are in the works, like being drafted, 
  > written or discussed by FIG.

- Proposed

  > Recommendations that are ready to be voted by Board

- Rejected

  > Proposals that have been voted down by Board during Draft Approval, Board 
  > Review or Final Approval.

- Withdrawn

  > PSRs that are withdrawn from the Board by their Specification Leads before 
  > going to Final Release.

## Proposing a Recommendation

Github is the central point of support of FIG. 

Anyone is allowed to fork and add a document or even open a ticket proposing 
a new PSR. 
The Board then will be able to guide any contributor until the proposed idea 
becomes ready to be reviewed.
