PHP Framework Interoperability Group
====================================

The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the
commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main
audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community
is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to
do so, but that is not the aim.


Proposing a Standards Recommendation
------------------------------------

To propose a standards recommendation (PSR):

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the PSR in
  `proposed/`, push the branch to Github, and send a pull request; or,

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github; or,

- start a conversation on the [mailing list][].

[mailing list]: http://groups.google.com/group/php-fig/


Requesting Membership
---------------------

You **do not** need to be a voting member to participate in discussion on
the [mailing list][].

To become a voting member, you must send an email to the [mailing list][].

- The subject line should read: `Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})`

- The body should include your name, the name of (and link to) the project you
  represent, and other details you feel are relevant.

- Current members will vote on your request.

Do not combine separate membership requests in a single thread; one request
