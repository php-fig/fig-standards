PSR-2 Meta Document
===================

1. Summary
----------

The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from different authors. It does so 
by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code.

The style rules herein are derived from commonalities among the various member projects. When various authors 
collaborate across multiple projects, it helps to have one set of guidelines to be used among all those 
projects. Thus, the benefit of this guide is not in the rules themselves, but in the sharing of those rules.

3. Errata
---------

1. _[09/08/2013]_ Using one or more multi-line arguments (i.e: arrays or anonymous functions) does not constitute 
splitting the argument list itself, therefore Section 4.6 is not automatically enforced. Arrays and anonymous 
functions are able to span multiple lines.

The following examples are perfectly valid in PSR-2:

```php
<?php
somefunction($foo, $bar, [
  // ...
], $baz);

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) { 
    return 'Hello '.$app->escape($name); 
});
```
