Common Interface for Caching Libraries
======================================

This document describes a simple yet extensible interface for a cache item and
a cache driver.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

The final implementations MAY decorate the objects with more
functionality than the one proposed but they MUST implement the indicated
interfaces/functionality first.

[RFC 2119]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119

1. Specification
-----------------

## 1.1 Introduction

Caching is a common way to improve the performance of any project, making
caching libraries one of the most common features of many frameworks and
libraries. Interoperability at this level means libraries can drop their
own caching implementations and easily rely on the one given to them by the
framework, or another dedicated cache library.

PSR-6 solves this problem already, but in a rather formal and verbose way for
what the most simple use cases need. This simpler approach aims to build a
standardized streamlined interface for common cases.  It is independent of
PSR-6 but has been designed to make compatibility with PSR-6 as straightforward
as possible.

### 1.2 Definitions

Definitions for Calling Library, Implementing Library, TTL, Expiration and Key
are copied from PSR-6 as the same assumptions are true.

*    **Calling Library** - The library or code that actually needs the cache
services. This library will utilize caching services that implement this
standard's interfaces, but will otherwise have no knowledge of the
implementation of those caching services.

*    **Implementing Library** - This library is responsible for implementing
this standard in order to provide caching services to any Calling Library. The
Implementing Library MUST provide a class implementing the Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface interface.
Implementing Libraries MUST support at minimum TTL functionality as described
below with whole-second granularity.

*    **TTL** - The Time To Live (TTL) of an item is the amount of time between
when that item is stored and it is considered stale. The TTL is normally defined
by an integer representing time in seconds, or a DateInterval object.

*    **Expiration** - The actual time when an item is set to go stale. This is
calculated by adding the TTL to the time when an object is stored.

    An item with a 300 second TTL stored at 1:30:00 will have an expiration of 1:35:00.

    Implementing Libraries MAY expire an item before its requested Expiration Time,
but MUST treat an item as expired once its Expiration Time is reached. If a calling
library asks for an item to be saved but does not specify an expiration time, or
specifies a null expiration time or TTL, an Implementing Library MAY use a configured
default duration. If no default duration has been set, the Implementing Library
MUST interpret that as a request to cache the item forever, or for as long as the
underlying implementation supports.

    If a negative or zero TTL is provided, the item MUST be deleted from the cache
if it exists, as it is expired already.

*    **Key** - A string of at least one character that uniquely identifies a
cached item. Implementing libraries MUST support keys consisting of the
characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, and `.` in any order in UTF-8 encoding and a
length of up to 64 characters. Implementing libraries MAY support additional
characters and encodings or longer lengths, but must support at least that
minimum.  Libraries are responsible for their own escaping of key strings
as appropriate, but MUST be able to return the original unmodified key string.
The following characters are reserved for future extensions and MUST NOT be
supported by implementing libraries: `{}()/\@:`

*    **Cache** - An object that implements the `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface` interface.

*    **Cache Misses** - A cache miss will return null and therefore detecting
if one stored `null` is not possible. This is the main deviation from PSR-6's
assumptions.

### 1.3 Cache

Implementations MAY provide a mechanism for a user to specify a default TTL
if one is not specified for a specific cache item.  If no user-specified default
is provided implementations MUST default to the maximum legal value allowed by
the underlying implementation.  If the underlying implementation does not
support TTL, the user-specified TTL MUST be silently ignored.

### 1.4 Data

Implementing libraries MUST support all serializable PHP data types, including:

*    **Strings** - Character strings of arbitrary size in any PHP-compatible encoding.
*    **Integers** - All integers of any size supported by PHP, up to 64-bit signed.
*    **Floats** - All signed floating point values.
*    **Boolean** - True and False.
*    **Null** - The null value (although it will not be distinguishable from a 
cache miss when reading it back out).
*    **Arrays** - Indexed, associative and multidimensional arrays of arbitrary depth.
*    **Object** - Any object that supports lossless serialization and
deserialization such that $o == unserialize(serialize($o)). Objects MAY
leverage PHP's Serializable interface, `__sleep()` or `__wakeup()` magic methods,
or similar language functionality if appropriate.

All data passed into the Implementing Library MUST be returned exactly as
passed. That includes the variable type. That is, it is an error to return
(string) 5 if (int) 5 was the value saved.  Implementing Libraries MAY use PHP's
serialize()/unserialize() functions internally but are not required to do so.
Compatibility with them is simply used as a baseline for acceptable object values.

If it is not possible to return the exact saved value for any reason, implementing
libraries MUST respond with a cache miss rather than corrupted data.


2. Interfaces
-------------

### 2.1 CacheInterface

The cache interface defines the most basic operations on a collection of cache-entries, which
entails basic reading, writing and deleting individual cache items.

In addition it has methods for dealing with multiple sets of cache entries such as writing, reading or
deleting multiple cache entries at a time. This is useful when you have lots of cache reads/writes
to perform, and lets you perform your operations in a single call to the cache server cutting down latency
times dramatically.

An instance of CacheInterface corresponds to a single collection of cache items with a single key namespace,
and is equivalent to a "Pool" in PSR-6.  Different CacheInterface instances MAY be backed by the same
datastore, but MUST be logically independent.
