        * (mandatory) __Psr0_ProjectRootNamespaces__
          is a colon separates list of the root namespaces used in your project (e.g. Liip:Jns)..
        
        * (mandatory) __Psr0_ScannerStartDir__
          represents the absolute or relative path to your source files (e.g. ../src/).
        
        * (optional) __Psr0_ScannerInclude__
          is a colon separated set of patterns which directories/files are to be recognized when scanning.
        
        * (optional) __Psr0_ScannerExclude__
          is a colon separated set of patterns which directories/files are to be ignored when scanning.
          You usually want to exclude the directories containing the tests and 3rd party source probably located in a
          vendor directory. This combines into the string shown in the following example:
            
              */vendor/*:*/Test/*
          
        See [*DirectoryScanner*][3] on GitHub for further information.
